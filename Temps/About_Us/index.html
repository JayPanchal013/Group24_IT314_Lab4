            <h5>This is basically a web app to identify false news in news articles and other
                forms. </h5>
            <p>Fake news has existed since the beginning of time. However, since the advent
                of the Internet, the rate at which fake news has spread has increased manifold.
                Given the ease of access to information, it has become very easy for people to
                spread false information and manipulate public opinion.
                </p>
            <p>This has led to significant consequences, including spreading misinformation,
                manipulating public opinion, and undermining trust in journalism and other
                sources of credible information.
                </p>
            <p>As a result, such technological solutions become extremely important to help
                people identify and flag false news and distinguish between credible and
                unreliable sources of information. In conclusion, developing a fake news
                classifier such as FakeRanks Faux Real is essential for addressing the
                challenges posed by the spread of false information online and ensuring the
                credibility and integrity of information in the digital age.
